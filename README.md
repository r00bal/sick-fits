# sick-fits
This is a full-stack online shop application build during Wes Bos' Fullstack Advanced React &amp; GraphQL course. This project uses GraphQL API with Node.js on the backend and React.js and Apollo on the frontend. It includes many server-side bits, including JWT authentication, permissions, sending an email, uploading images, Pagination, and charging credit cards. Also, complex Relational Data queries and server-side mutations like signing up or checking-out and testing React Components. The next TODO for this app is to switch to new Prisma schema, change render props into hooks wherever possible, and develop user account section.
